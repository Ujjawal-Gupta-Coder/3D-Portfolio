## <a name="AboutMe">😀 About Me</a>

I’m a full-stack software developer who loves turning ideas into fast, modern, and intelligent web experiences. I work with Next.js, React, MERN stack, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and C++. I’m also comfortable with tools like Sanity, Cloudinary, and MongoDB, giving me everything I need to build scalable, production-quality applications. I recently completed a six-month internship at TickYourList, where I built frontend features, developed an admin dashboard, improved UI/UX, collaborated with a team, and learned how to bring AI into everyday development to boost efficiency and problem-solving. Alongside this, I’m pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications(BCA) from Vikram University, Ujjain.

I love building products that truly solve problems, and two of my favorite creations are IdeaLink and ChatSphere. IdeaLink is a platform designed to connect innovators with investors—it lets founders pitch their ideas, lets investors engage with them, and even includes AI-powered tools like pitch generation, smart summaries, and startup recommendations. ChatSphere, on the other hand, is a real-time chat app where users can exchange messages and images instantly, see who’s online, and even view typing indicators for a more human, real-time feel. These projects reflect my focus on interactivity, usability, and building experiences that feel alive.
